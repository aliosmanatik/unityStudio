### File naming conventions:

Since Meshlab filters are used to create textures, there is a naming convention involved from that step.
Expected naming convention is:

- model name : modelFileName.obj
- mtl file   : modelFileName.obj.mtl
- texture    : texdefrag_modelFileName.obj_optimized_texture_0.png

*.mtl is not necessary for program to run.
