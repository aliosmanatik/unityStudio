### File naming conventions:

Since Meshlab filters are used to create textures, there is a naming convention coming involved from that step.
Expected naming conveintion is like this:

model name : modelFileName.obj
mtl file   : modelFileName.obj.mtl
texture    : texdefrag_modelFileName.obj_optimized_texture_0.png

*.mtl is not necessary for program to run.
