### File naming conventions:

Since Meshlab filters are used to create textures, there is a naming convention involved from that step.
Expected naming convention is:

- model name : generated.photos*****.obj
- mtl file   : generated.photos*****.obj.mtl
- texture    : texdefrag_generated.photos*****.obj_optimized_texture_0.png

*.mtl is not necessary for program to run.
