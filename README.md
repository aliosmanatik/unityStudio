### ***This application is a part of my thesis project***

### File naming conventions:

Since Meshlab filters are used to create textures, there is a naming convention involved from that step.
Expected naming convention is:

- model name : modelFileName.obj
- mtl file   : modelFileName.obj.mtl
- texture    : texdefrag_modelFileName.obj_optimized_texture_0.png

*.mtl is not necessary for program to run. 


## Planned updates:

- ~~Auto exposure on/off toggle in "settings"~~
- link to thesis repository in "about"
